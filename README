This is a skeleton of an "ON" (illumos) build.

You can use it to build drivers, libraries, and commands,
that you might plan to later integrate into illumos, but
don't want to wait for full illumos builds while you're
developing your code.

As provided, this skeleton builds one driver, one library,
and one command, all named "foo".  These are intentionally
trivial objects, just to demonstrate how it builds.

The developer script quickbuild builds everything here.
If you copy quickbuild into a full illumos workspace
after integrating what you prototype in this skeleton,
then quickbuild will do a "partial build" for you.
(Quickly build just these components.)

This does not do any package building (no IPS, no SysV).
The quickbuild script can create a tarball that you can
copy to a test machine and unpack there as a quick way
to "install".


Here is a list of all the places you might want to copy
to add another driver, library, or command:

	uts/common/sys/foo.h
	uts/common/io/foo/*
	uts/common/Makefile.files	(FOO_OBJS += foo.o)
	uts/common/Makefile.rules	(common/io/foo, two places)
	uts/intel/Makefile.intel.shared	(DRV_KMODS += foo)
	uts/intel/foo/Makefile
	uts/sparc/Makefile.sparc.shared	(DRV_KMODS += foo)
	uts/sparc/foo/Makefile

	lib/libfoo/Makefile
	lib/libfoo/Makefile.com
	lib/libfoo/*/Makefile
	lib/libfoo/common/*

	cmd/foo

	man/man1/foo.1
	man/man3x/libfoo.3x
	man/man7/foo.7

	quickbuild
